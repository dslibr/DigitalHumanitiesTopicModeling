## List of Topics

Nineteen topics were discovered from the titles and abstracts in the list of digital humanities items provided by the library. The table below shows the topic number and the name. Many of the topics included multiple subtopics, 
which are separated by semi-colons in the table.

Names were assigned to topics after careful analysis of the titles and abstracts in conjunction with the <i>Top-30 Most Salient Terms</i> bar chart. The bar chart shows the top-30 most relevant terms for each topic and the 
estimated frequency of each term within the whole document as well as within the given topic. This interactive graph also includes the <i>Intertopic Distance Map</i> and 
both can be accessed below and from the navigation bar on the left:
